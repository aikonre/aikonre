# 🙋‍♂️ Hey world, I'm aikon! 

👾 Not an alien, just a human who enjoys typing `npm run dev` like it's a magic spell.  
⚙️ Currently trying to be a frontliner in the Web3 world, though I still mess up `git push` sometimes 😅  
🚀 My latest mission? A token dashboard that *hopefully* makes empty wallets look cooler 😎
